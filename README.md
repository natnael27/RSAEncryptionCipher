# RSA ENCRYPTION CIPHER
RSA is a public-key encryption cipher that uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission. 
It was named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who introduced it in 1977.

In the RSA encryption cipher, each participant has a public and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone and is used for encryption, while the private key is kept secret and is used 
for decryption. The security of RSA encryption relies on the fact that factoring large prime numbers is computationally difficult.

To encrypt a message using RSA, the sender encrypts the message using the receiver's public key. 
The receiver can then decrypt the message using their private key. RSA is widely used for secure communication over the internet, such as in online banking and email communication.
